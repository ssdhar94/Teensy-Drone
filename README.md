# Teensy-Drone
An experimental flight controller based on Teensy 4.1 and ICM20948 IMU. 

This repository contains the source code related to Teensy 4.1 based flight controller. This was a project I undertook while working at Robotics and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad.
This project is inspired from https://github.com/nickrehm/dRehmFlight controller and https://github.com/CarbonAeronautics/Manual-Quadcopter-Drone. This helped me understand the inner workings of flight controller.

Hardware:
 1. Teensy 4.1
 2. ICM-20948 IMU
 3. FlySky iA10B RC
 4. SimonK ESC
